# COPULA-ARMA-GARCH-modeling-for-US-stocks

Hi! This repository presents a developed strategy for predicting the returns of stocks included in the investor's portfolio for a user-defined future period, based on ARMA-GARCH models for each stock in the portfolio, for which the residuals are replaced with random variables modeled from the copula distribution of logarithmic returns of stocks in the portfolio.

There are 4 main steps:
1) The user loads a list of stock tickers that make up the portfolio, selects a historical time interval for uploading quotes.
2) 32 different variations of ARMA-GARCH models are calculated for each stock and the best one is selected based on the BIC criterion
  ! It is important to note that there are some problems in choosing a right method for optimizing ARMA-GARCH model parameters, but this issue is beyond the scope of         this study. I will only note that the "nloptr" method is used in this work
3) Based on the BIC criterion, the best copula model describing the residuals of the calculated ARMA-GARCH models is determined
4) At the last step, future stock returns are predicted, where in the ARMA-GARCH models the residuals are replaced with random variables generated by the copula (average for 5000 generations)
5) Steps from 2 to 4 are executed sequentially in the 'portfolio_simulation' function
